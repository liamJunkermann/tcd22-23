{- Part 1

Write a function 'lower' that converts a string to lowercase

Hint: 'toLower :: Char -> Char' converts a character to lowercase
if it is uppercase. All other characters are unchanged.
It is imported should you want to use it.

-}
lower :: String -> String
lower = map toLower

{- Part 2

Write a function 'nth' that returns the nth element of a list.
Hint: the test will answer your Qs

-}
nth :: Int -> [a] -> a
nth n list = list !! (n -1)

{- Part 3

Write a function `commonPfx` that compares two sequences
and returns the prefix they have in common.

-}
commonPfx :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
commonPfx (x : xs) (y : ys) | x == y = x : commonPfx xs ys
commonPfx _ _ = []

{- Part 4

(TRICKY!) (VERY!)

Write a function `runs` that converts a list of things
into a list of sublists, each containing elements of the same value,
which when concatenated together give the same list

So `runs [1,2,2,1,3,3,3,2,2,1,1,4]`
 becomes `[[1],[2,2],[1],[3,3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[4]]`

Hint:  `elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool`

HINT: Don't worry about code efficiency
       Seriously, don't!

-}
runs :: Eq a => [a] -> [[a]]
runs [] = []
runs [a] = [[a]]
runs (x : x1 : xs) =
  let (head : tail) = runs (x1 : xs)
   in if x == x1
        then (x : head) : tail
        else [x] : head : tail

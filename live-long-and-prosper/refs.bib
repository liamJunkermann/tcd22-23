  abstract  = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There has been growing evidence that
               lifestyle factors may affect the health and lifespan of an
               individual by affecting telomere length. The purpose of this
               review was to highlight the importance of telomeres in human
               health and aging and to summarize possible lifestyle factors
               that may affect health and longevity by altering the rate of
               telomere shortening. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies indicate
               that telomere length, which can be affected by various lifestyle
               factors, can affect the pace of aging and onset of
               age-associated diseases. SUMMARY: Telomere length shortens with
               age. Progressive shortening of telomeres leads to senescence,
               apoptosis, or oncogenic transformation of somatic cells,
               affecting the health and lifespan of an individual. Shorter
               telomeres have been associated with increased incidence of
               diseases and poor survival. The rate of telomere shortening can
               be either increased or decreased by specific lifestyle factors.
               Better choice of diet and activities has great potential to
               reduce the rate of telomere shortening or at least prevent
               excessive telomere attrition, leading to delayed onset of
               age-associated diseases and increased lifespan. This review
               highlights the role of telomeres in aging and describes the
               lifestyle factors which may affect telomeres, human health, and
               aging.},

  abstract = {Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological
              integrity, leading to impaired function and increased
              vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk
              factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes,
              cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging
              research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent
              years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is
              controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and
              biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review
              enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common
              denominators of aging in different organisms, with special
              emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic
              instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of
              proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial
              dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and
              altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to
              dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks
              and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of
              identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during
              aging, with minimal side effects.},

  abstract = {Telomeres protect the integrity of information-carrying DNA by
              serving as caps on the terminal portions of chromosomes. Telomere
              length decreases with aging, and this contributes to cell
              senescence. Recent evidence supports that telomere length of
              leukocytes and skeletal muscle cells may be positively associated
              with healthy living and inversely correlated with the risk of
              several age-related diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular
              disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic pain, and stress. In
              observational studies, higher levels of physical activity or
              exercise are related to longer telomere lengths in various
              populations, and athletes tend to have longer telomere lengths
              than non-athletes. This relationship is particularly evident in
              older individuals, suggesting a role of physical activity in
              combating the typical age-induced decrements in telomere length.
              To date, a small number of exercise interventions have been
              executed to examine the potential influence of chronic exercise
              on telomere length, but these studies have not fully established
              such relationship. Several potential mechanisms through which
              physical activity or exercise could affect telomere length are
              discussed, including changes in telomerase activity, oxidative
              stress, inflammation, and decreased skeletal muscle satellite
              cell content. Future research is needed to mechanistically
              examine the effects of various modalities of exercise on telomere
              length in middle-aged and older adults, as well as in specific
              clinical populations.},

               diastolic pressure, is the most prevalent type of hypertension
               in those aged 50 or over, occurring either de novo or as a
               development after a long period of systolic-diastolic
               hypertension with or without treatment. The increase in blood
               pressure with age is mostly associated with structural changes
               in the arteries and especially with large artery stiffness. It
               is known from various studies that rising blood pressure is
               associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In the elderly,
               the most powerful predictor of risk is increased pulse pressure
               due to decreased diastolic and increased systolic blood
               pressure. All evidence indicates that treating the elderly
               hypertensive patient will reduce the risk of cardiovascular
               events. However, there is no evidence yet for the very elderly.
               This population is particularly susceptible to side effects of
               treatments and the reduction of blood pressure, although
               reducing the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, may

  author    = {Dause, Tyler J and Kirby, Elizabeth D},
  abstract  = {Cognitive impairment is a consequence of the normal aging
               process that effects many species, including humans and rodent
               models. Decline in hippocampal memory function is especially
               prominent with age and often reduces quality of life. As the
               aging population expands, the need for interventional strategies
               to prevent cognitive decline has become more pressing.
               Fortunately, several major lifestyle factors have proven
               effective at combating hippocampal aging, the most well-known of
               which are environmental enrichment and exercise. While the
               evidence supporting the beneficial nature of these factors is
               substantial, a less well-understood factor may also contribute
               to healthy cognitive aging: social engagement. We review the
               evidence supporting the role of social engagement in preserving
               hippocampal function in old age. In elderly humans, high levels
               of social engagement correlate with better hippocampal function,
               yet there is a dearth of work to indicate a causative role.
               Existing rodent literature is also limited but has begun to
               provide causative evidence and establish candidate mechanisms.
               Summed together, while many unanswered questions remain, it is
               clear that social engagement is a viable lifestyle factor for
               preserving cognitive function in old age. Social integration
               across the lifespan warrants more investigation and more
               appreciation when designing living circumstances for the
               elderly.},
